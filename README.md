#ORM
(object reltional mapping)
when we talked about large interprise/organization where we have to write different quries or we can say big complex queries for each CRUD operation, we basically dont use plain drivers of database 
what i mean to say is we dont use SQL queries
What ORM basically provide is a abstraction layer, it provide an obect oriented layer interface to relational database where we can intreact with database using objects and their properties
